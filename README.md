dtls
======
This is a tiny fork of https://github.com/bocajim/dtls that works around an issue in the DTLS handshake when connecting to an IKEA Tr√•dfri Gateway.

The rest of this README is identical to the original at the time of the forking.

This package implements a [RFC-4347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4347) compliant DTLS client and server.  NOTE: This library is under active development and is not yet stable enough to be used in production.

Key Features
------------
* Pure go, no CGo
* Supports both client and server via UDP
* Supports TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 cipher [RFC-6655](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6655)
* Supports pre-shared key authentication, does not support certificate based authentication
* Supports DTLS session resumption
* Designed for OMA LWM2M comliance [LWM2M](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/release-program/current-releases/oma-lightweightm2m-v1-0)

TODO
----
* Implement session renegotiation
* Implement packet retransmission for handshake
* Implement out of order handshake processing
* Implement replay detection
* Implement client hello stateless cookie handling
* Improve parallel processing of incoming packets
* Add interface for custom DTLS session cache storage

Samples
-------
Keystore
```go
	mks := keystore.NewMemoryKeyStore()
	keystore.SetKeyStores([]keystore.KeyStore{mks})
	psk, _ := hex.DecodeString("00112233445566")
	mks.AddKey("myIdentity", psk)
```

Sample Client
```go
	listener, _ = NewUdpListener(":6000", time.Second*5)
	peer, err := listener.AddPeer("127.0.0.1:5684", "myIdentity")

	err = peer.Write("hello world")
	data, rsp := listener.Read()
```
